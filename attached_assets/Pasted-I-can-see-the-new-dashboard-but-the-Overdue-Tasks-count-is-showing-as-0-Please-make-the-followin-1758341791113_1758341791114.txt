I can see the new dashboard, but the 'Overdue Tasks' count is showing as 0. Please make the following updates:

Use real project data only â€” avoid dummy data.

Add missing visualizations:

Tasks by Owner

Risk Heatmap

Refer to the attached screenshot and implement all possible widgets based on the information available in our system.

If any data points required for these visualizations are not available in our system, let me know whatâ€™s missing so we can plan to capture it and make this dashboard fully functional."
