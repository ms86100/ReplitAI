1. Bug Fixes / Issues to Resolve
Tasks by Priority (Bug)

Issue: Even though data exists in the table for Critical, High, Medium, Low, the graph is not showing values.

Fix:

Ensure the graph is bound to the same dataset as the table.

Add validation to check if data retrieval or filtering is failing.

Handle cases where values = 0 (graph should still display categories with 0).

Risk Heatmap (Improvement)

Issue: Current risk heatmap is not explanatory enough.

Enhancement:

Categorize risks into:

Total Risks (count)

High Priority Risks (count + list)

Medium Priority Risks

Low Priority Risks

Visuals:

Heatmap grid with Impact vs Probability.

Color coding: Red (High), Orange (Medium), Green (Low).

Tooltip or drilldown → show details of each risk.

Tasks Inside Milestones

Issue: Tasks linked to a milestone are not displayed in milestone dashboards.

Fix:

Update queries to fetch tasks associated with milestones.

Show in both tabular view and graph view under milestones.

Graph: bar chart or stacked progress indicator per milestone.

Task Details → Rename + Overdue Filter

Requirement:

Rename “Task Details” section → “Overdue Tasks”.

Only display tasks where Due Date < Today and Status ≠ Completed.

Apply this in table and charts.

Charts should show overdue tasks by project, priority, and owner.

2. Portfolio Dashboard Requirements (Modules)
