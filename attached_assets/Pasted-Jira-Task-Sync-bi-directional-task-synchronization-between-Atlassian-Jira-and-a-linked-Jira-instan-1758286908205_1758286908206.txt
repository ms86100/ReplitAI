Jira Task Sync — bi-directional task synchronization between Atlassian Jira and a linked Jira instance

Description (for backlog / Replit)

Add a Jira Task Sync feature to enable bi-directional synchronization of tasks between an Atlassian Jira project and a linked external Jira project. This lets teams collaborate across separate Jira instances while keeping control over which tasks are shared.

Key behavior

Project-level setup: A project admin links the Atlassian Jira project to an external Jira project by entering the necessary Jira API credentials in Project Settings.

User-controlled sync: When creating or editing a task/story in the backlog, present a clear prompt or toggle: “Do you want to sync this task with the external Jira?”

Selecting Yes pushes the task to the linked Jira project and creates a linked issue.

Selecting No keeps the task local to the current Jira instance.

Field mapping & creation: Use a preconfigured mapping to translate task fields (Title, Description, Priority, etc.) into the target Jira fields and create the issue in the designated external Jira project.

Bi-directional updates:

Changes in the source Jira project (status, comments, description edits, etc.) are synced to the linked external Jira issue.

Updates made in the linked external Jira issue are synced back to the source Jira project so both systems remain consistent.

Visual status indicator: Display an “In sync with external Jira” icon on the task card (hover reveals the external Jira issue key and link).

Safety controls: Prevent accidental duplicates by requiring explicit user confirmation before creating the external Jira issue. Provide clear error/sync logs if a sync fails.

Acceptance criteria (suggested)

Project settings include a secure form to store external Jira API credentials and configure the target external Jira project.

Backlog and create/edit flows show a sync prompt/toggle that defaults to No.

When a user opts in, an issue is created in the external Jira with mapped fields and the source task stores the external Jira issue key/link.

Edits on either side (source Jira ↔ external Jira) propagate correctly within a reasonable time window; conflicts are handled with a clear policy/log.

Task cards show a sync icon with the external Jira key on hover; clicking the icon opens the external Jira issue.

Failures surface readable error messages and retry/log options for admins.

Benefits

Enables controlled cross-instance collaboration with external Jira teams.

Avoids accidental duplicates by requiring per-task confirmation.

Keeps both Jira instances aligned through automatic, two-way updates.
